# Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW/TIG)

Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), commonly known as "TIG welding," is a precision welding process that produces high-quality welds with excellent appearance and mechanical properties. This module covers the principles, equipment, techniques, and applications of GTAW, providing you with the knowledge needed to master this demanding but rewarding welding process.

## Process Overview

GTAW uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to create an electric arc with the workpiece. A separate filler metal is added manually when required, and an inert gas (typically argon) shields the electrode, arc, and weld pool from atmospheric contamination. The process offers precise heat control and produces clean, high-quality welds.

## Equipment Components

### Power Source
- **Constant current (CC) power source**: Provides drooping characteristic
- **AC or DC output**: Different materials require different current types
- **High frequency unit**: Assists in arc starting
- **Balance control (AC only)**: Controls cleaning action vs. penetration

### Torch Assembly
- **Tungsten electrode**: Non-consumable electrode (2% thoriated or ceriated)
- **Collet and collet body**: Hold electrode in position
- **Gas cup**: Directs shielding gas flow
- **Gas diffuser**: Distributes gas evenly
- **Torch body**: Houses all components

### Gas Supply System
- **Argon cylinder**: Primary shielding gas
- **Regulator/flowmeter**: Controls gas pressure and flow
- **Hose**: Connects gas supply to torch
- **Flow rate**: Typically 15-25 cubic feet per hour

### Filler Metal
- **Rods or wire**: Added manually to weld pool
- **Material match**: Must match or exceed base metal properties
- **Diameter selection**: Based on material thickness

### Foot or Hand Control
- **Amperage control**: Allows precise heat adjustment during welding
- **Foot pedal**: Most common control method
- **Hand control**: Alternative for specific applications

## Tungsten Electrodes

### Pure Tungsten (Green)
- Non-radioactive
- Good for AC aluminum welding
- Forms balled tip
- Lower current capacity

### Thoriated Tungsten (Red)
- 2% thorium oxide additive
- Higher current capacity
- Better arc stability
- Radioactive (requires proper handling)

### Ceriated Tungsten (Orange)
- 2% cerium oxide additive
- Non-radioactive alternative to thoriated
- Good arc starting characteristics
- Excellent for DC applications

### Lanthanated Tungsten (Gold)
- 1-2% lanthanum oxide
- Excellent arc stability
- Good longevity
- Non-radioactive

### Electrode Preparation
- **Pointed tip**: For DC applications (sharp point)
- **Balled tip**: For AC applications (spherical ball)
- **Diameter**: Match to current requirements
- **Cleaning**: Remove contaminants between uses

## Shielding Gases

### Argon
- Primary gas for most GTAW applications
- Excellent shielding properties
- Good cleaning action
- Suitable for all materials

### Helium
- Higher heat input than argon
- Better for thick materials
- Faster travel speeds possible
- More expensive than argon

### Argon/Helium Mixtures
- Combines benefits of both gases
- Improved heat input over pure argon
- Better cleaning than pure helium
- Variable ratios for specific applications

### Argon/Hydrogen Mixtures
- Increased heat input and fluidity
- Limited to ferrous materials
- Good for stainless steel
- Risk of hydrogen cracking

## Basic Techniques

### Setup and Adjustment
1. Select appropriate tungsten type and size
2. Prepare tungsten electrode (point or ball)
3. Choose proper shielding gas
4. Set amperage and gas flow rate
5. Position torch and filler rod for comfortable access

### Arc Starting Methods
1. **Lift-arc**: Electrode lifted from work to start arc
2. **High-frequency**: High-frequency current starts arc without contact
3. **Pulse start**: Combination of high frequency and pulsing

### Torch and Filler Rod Positioning
- **Torch angle**: 10-15 degrees from vertical
- **Work angle**: 15-20 degrees in direction of travel
- **Filler rod angle**: 15-20 degrees from horizontal
- **Hand positions**: Develop comfortable, consistent positions

### Welding Technique
- **Heat control**: Use foot/hand control for precise heat adjustment
- **Travel speed**: Adjust to maintain consistent puddle size and appearance
- **Filler rod manipulation**: Add wire to front of puddle in small increments
- **Finishing technique**: Reduce heat gradually to prevent crater cracking

## Material-Specific Techniques

### Carbon and Low Alloy Steels
