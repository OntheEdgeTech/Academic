# Oxy-Fuel Cutting and Welding

Oxy-fuel processes use the chemical energy of fuel gases combined with oxygen to produce high-temperature flames for cutting and welding metals. These versatile processes require no electrical power, making them ideal for field work and remote locations. This module covers the principles, equipment, techniques, and safety considerations for oxy-fuel cutting and welding.

## Process Principles

### Oxy-Fuel Welding (OFW)
- Uses fuel gas and oxygen to create a high-temperature flame
- Melts base metals and adds filler rod to form joint
- Also known as gas welding or oxyacetylene welding

### Oxy-Fuel Cutting (OFC)
- Uses fuel gas and oxygen to cut through steel
- Preheats steel to ignition temperature (around 1,500°F)
- High-pressure oxygen jet oxidizes and removes molten metal

## Fuel Gases

### Acetylene (C2H2)
- Most common fuel gas for welding and cutting
- Produces hottest flame (6,300°F with oxygen)
- Requires special handling due to instability under pressure
- Dissolved in acetone in cylinders for safe storage

### Propane (C3H8)
- Less expensive than acetylene
- Lower flame temperature (5,200°F with oxygen)
- More stable and safer to handle
- Good for heating and brazing applications

### Propylene (C3H6)
- Intermediate between acetylene and propane
- Higher flame temperature than propane (5,600°F with oxygen)
- More stable than acetylene
- Increasingly used as acetylene substitute

### Natural Gas (CH4)
- Available where pipeline gas exists
- Lower flame temperature
- Good for heating applications
- Limited for welding and cutting

### MAPP Gas (Methylacetylene-Propadiene)
- Stabilized methylacetylene-propadiene mixture
- Higher flame temperature than propane
- More stable than acetylene
- Less common due to acetylene availability

## Oxy-Fuel Welding (OFW)

### Flame Types
1. **Neutral Flame**: Equal amounts of fuel gas and oxygen
   - Temperature: 5,800-6,300°F
   - Most common for welding
   - No chemical effect on molten metal

2. **Carburizing Flame**: Excess fuel gas
   - Temperature: 5,000-5,500°F
   - Adds carbon to weld metal
   - Used for high-carbon steels and some surfacing

3. **Oxidizing Flame**: Excess oxygen
   - Temperature: 6,000-6,500°F
   - Removes carbon from weld metal
   - Used for brass and bronze welding

### Welding Techniques
- **Leftward technique**: Torch moves from right to left
   - Better for thin materials
   - More penetration
   - Easier to observe weld pool

- **Rightward technique**: Torch moves from left to right
   - Better for thick materials
   - More reinforcement
   - Requires more skill

### Joint Preparation
- **Edge preparation**: Square butt joints for thin materials
- **Bevel preparation**: V-groove for thicker materials
- **Root opening**: 1/8 to 1/4 inch typical
- **Fit-up**: Critical for good weld quality

### Filler Rods
- **Material selection**: Match or exceed base metal properties
- **Rod size**: Typically 1/8 to 1/4 inch diameter
- **Flux-coated rods**: For cast iron and dirty materials
- **Copper-based rods**: For brazing applications

## Oxy-Fuel Cutting (OFC)

### Cutting Process
1. **Preheat**: Flame heats steel to ignition temperature
2. **Ignition**: Cutting oxygen jet starts oxidation process
3. **Cutting**: High-pressure oxygen removes molten metal
4. **Progression**: Torch moves along cut line

### Cutting Flames
- **Preheat flames**: Two or more flames on either side of cutting oxygen
- **Adjustment**: Flames should be neutral (clear inner cone)
- **Temperature**: Approximately 1,500°F for steel ignition

### Cutting Parameters
- **Cutting oxygen pressure**: Varies with material thickness
- **Travel speed**: Adjusted for clean, smooth cuts
- **Torch angle**: 90° to material for preheat, 15-20° backward for cutting
- **Tip selection**: Based on material thickness

### Cutting Techniques
- **Straight line cutting**: Start at edge or pierce with drill hole
- **Curve cutting**: Torch angle adjusted for direction changes
- **Circle cutting**: Specialized cutting torches available
- **Bevel cutting**: Torch angle adjusted for angled cuts

### Common Cutting Problems
- **Incomplete cutting**: Insufficient preheat or oxygen pressure
- **Excessive drag**: Too slow travel speed or insufficient oxygen
- **Undercutting**: Too high oxygen pressure or torch too close
- **Topsiding**: Incorrect torch angle or excessive drag

## Brazing and Braze Welding

### Brazing
- **Temperature**: Below 840°F (450°C) for silver brazing
- **Filler metal**: Flows into joint by capillary action
- **Clearance**: Critical joint fit-up (0.002-0.006 inch)
- **Applications**: Joining dissimilar metals, leak-proof joints

### Braze Welding
- **Temperature**: Above 840°F (450°C)
- **Filler metal**: Deposited on surface, not flowing by capillarity
- **Joint preparation**: Similar to welding
- **Applications**: Repair work, joining heavy sections

## Safety Considerations

### Fire and Explosion Hazards
