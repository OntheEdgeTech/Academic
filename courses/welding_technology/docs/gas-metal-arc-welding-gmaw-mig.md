# Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW/MIG)

Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), commonly known as "MIG welding," is one of the most popular welding processes in manufacturing and fabrication industries. This module covers the fundamentals of GMAW equipment, techniques, and applications, providing you with the knowledge needed to produce quality welds with this efficient process.

## Process Overview

GMAW uses a continuous solid wire electrode fed through a welding gun, with an external shielding gas protecting the weld pool from atmospheric contamination. The process creates an electric arc between the electrode and the workpiece, melting both to form a weld pool.

## Equipment Components

### Power Source
- **Constant voltage (CV) power source**: Maintains relatively stable voltage
- **DC output**: Typically electrode positive (DCEP) for most materials
- **Amperage range**: 30-500+ amps depending on application
- **Voltage range**: 12-40+ volts

### Wire Feed System
- **Wire drive motor**: Pushes wire through feed rollers
- **Feed rollers**: Match wire type and size
- **Wire liner**: Guides wire from spool to gun
- **Wire spool**: Holds continuous electrode wire

### Welding Gun
- **Contact tip**: Electrically connects to wire
- **Gas diffuser**: Distributes shielding gas
- **Nozzle**: Directs shielding gas flow
- **Trigger**: Controls wire feed and power

### Gas Supply System
- **Gas cylinder**: Contains shielding gas
- **Regulator/flowmeter**: Controls gas pressure and flow
- **Hose**: Connects gas supply to welding gun
- **Typical flow rate**: 20-40 cubic feet per hour

## Shielding Gases

### Pure Argon
- Excellent for aluminum and non-ferrous metals
- Smooth, stable arc
- Good cleaning action on aluminum
- Lower penetration than other gases

### Argon/CO2 Mixtures
- **75% Argon / 25% CO2**: Common mixture for carbon steel
- Better penetration than pure argon
- Good arc stability
- Economical choice

### Pure CO2
- Deepest penetration of common gases
- Higher spatter levels
- Less expensive than argon mixtures
- Can be used for thick materials

### Other Gas Mixtures
- **Argon/Oxygen mixtures**: Improved penetration and wetting
- **Helium/Argon mixtures**: Higher heat input, good for aluminum
- **Tri-mix gases**: Specialized applications

## Transfer Modes

### Short Circuit Transfer
- Low voltage, low amperage
- Wire repeatedly shorts to weld pool
- Good for thin materials and out-of-position welding
- Moderate spatter level

### Globular Transfer
- Medium voltage and amperage
- Large droplets transfer irregularly
- Less common due to high spatter
- Generally avoided

### Spray Transfer
- High voltage, high amperage (above transition current)
- Fine droplets spray across arc
- Smooth, stable arc with minimal spatter
- Flat and horizontal positions preferred

### Pulsed Spray Transfer
- Modulated current (high and low pulses)
- Combines benefits of spray and short circuit transfer
- Good for all positions and various thicknesses
- Reduced heat input and distortion

## Electrode Wires

### Solid Wires
- **Mild steel**: ER70S-6 (most common)
- **Stainless steel**: ER308L, ER309L, etc.
- **Aluminum**: ER4043, ER5356, etc.

### Flux-Cored Wires
- Tubular wire with flux inside
- Self-shielding or gas-shielded variants
- Higher deposition rates
- Better for dirty or rusty steel

### Wire Selection Factors
- Base metal type and thickness
- Required mechanical properties
- Welding position
- Service conditions

## Basic Techniques

### Setup and Adjustment
1. Select appropriate wire type and size
2. Choose proper shielding gas
3. Set voltage and wire feed speed
4. Adjust gas flow rate (typically 20-25 CFH)
5. Check contact tip and nozzle condition

### Starting the Arc
- Pull trigger to start wire feed and power
- Maintain proper work angle (10-15 degrees)
- Keep consistent distance from workpiece (3/8 to 1/2 inch)

### Travel Technique
- **Push angle**: Gun angled in direction of travel
- **Travel speed**: Adjust for proper penetration and appearance
- **Weave pattern**: For wider joints when necessary
- **Gun position**: Maintain consistent angle and distance

### Welding Positions
1. **Flat (1G/1F)**: Easiest, highest deposition rate
2. **Horizontal (2G/2F)**: Requires more skill to control puddle
3. **Vertical (3G/3F)**: Upward progression preferred
4. **Overhead (4G/4F)**: Most challenging, requires proper technique

## Advanced Techniques

### Pulsed GMAW
- Uses modulated current for better control
- Reduces heat input and distortion
- Improves appearance in all positions
- Better for thin materials

### Spray Transfer Welding
- High current density for deep penetration
- Excellent for thick materials
- Minimal spatter when properly adjusted
- Requires argon-rich gas mixtures

### Aluminum Welding
- AC balance control for oxide removal
- Push technique preferred
- Higher gas flow rates needed
- Specialized wire feed systems

## Common Defects and Solutions

### Porosity
- **Cause**: Contaminated base metal, inadequate gas coverage
- **Solution**: Clean base metal, check gas flow, eliminate drafts

### Lack of Fusion
- **Cause**: Insufficient heat, fast travel speed
- **Solution**: Increase heat input, slow travel speed, proper joint preparation

### Undercut
- **Cause**: Excessive voltage, incorrect travel angle
- **Solution**: Reduce voltage, correct gun angle, increase travel speed

### Excessive Spatter
- **Cause**: Incorrect voltage/wire speed balance, contaminated wire
- **Solution**: Adjust parameters, clean wire, check gas mixture

### Burn-Through
- **Cause**: Excessive heat input, insufficient thickness
- **Solution**: Reduce amperage, increase travel speed, use backing bars

## Equipment Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- Clean contact tip and nozzle
- Check wire feed system for smooth operation
- Inspect gas connections for leaks
- Verify proper gas flow rate

### Weekly Maintenance
- Lubricate wire feed motor and drive system
- Clean wire liner (if removable)
- Check and clean gun neck and diffuser
- Inspect power source for proper operation

### Monthly Maintenance
- Replace worn contact tips and nozzles
- Clean or replace wire feed rollers
- Check and calibrate gas flowmeter
- Service power source according to manufacturer recommendations
