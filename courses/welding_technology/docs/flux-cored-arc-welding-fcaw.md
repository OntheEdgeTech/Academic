# Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW)

Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW) is a semi-automatic or automatic welding process that uses a continuous tubular wire filled with flux materials. This versatile process combines the high deposition rates of submerged arc welding with the portability and flexibility of GMAW. This module covers the principles, equipment, techniques, and applications of FCAW.

## Process Overview

FCAW operates similarly to GMAW but uses a tubular wire electrode filled with flux materials instead of solid wire. The flux provides shielding gases and slag protection for the weld pool, and may also add alloying elements and deoxidizers. FCAW can operate with or without external shielding gas, making it highly versatile.

## Types of FCAW

### Self-Shielded FCAW (FCAW-S)
- No external shielding gas required
- Flux in the wire provides all shielding
- More portable than gas-shielded variant
- Better for outdoor and windy conditions

### Gas-Shielded FCAW (FCAW-G)
- Requires external shielding gas
- Uses CO2 or argon/CO2 mixtures
- Better weld appearance and quality
- Less smoke and spatter than self-shielded

## Equipment Components

### Power Source
- **Constant voltage (CV) power source**: Same as GMAW
- **DC electrode positive (DCEP)**: Standard polarity
- **Amperage range**: 50-600+ amps depending on application
- **Voltage range**: 18-40+ volts

### Wire Feed System
- **Wire drive motor**: Push or push-pull system
- **Feed rollers**: Special design for flux-cored wires
- **Wire liner**: Larger diameter for flux-cored wires
- **Wire spool**: Larger spools for continuous operation

### Welding Gun
- **Contact tip**: Larger than GMAW for flux-cored wire
- **Gas diffuser**: Used only for gas-shielded variant
- **Nozzle**: Larger opening for flux-cored applications
- **Trigger**: Controls wire feed and power

### Gas Supply System (Gas-Shielded Only)
- **Gas cylinder**: CO2 or argon/CO2 mixture
- **Regulator/flowmeter**: Controls gas pressure and flow
- **Hose**: Connects gas supply to welding gun
- **Flow rate**: 25-35 cubic feet per hour

## Flux-Cored Wires

### Self-Shielded Wires
- **E71T-1**: All-position, 70,000 psi tensile strength
- **E71T-14**: All-position, 70,000 psi, higher deposition
- **E71T-8**: All-position, 70,000 psi, multiple current types

### Gas-Shielded Wires
- **E71T-11**: All-position, 70,000 psi, CO2 shielding
- **E71T-12**: All-position, 70,000 psi, CO2 shielding
- **E71T-14**: All-position, 70,000 psi, CO2 shielding, higher deposition

### Wire Selection Factors
- **Base metal type and thickness**
- **Required mechanical properties**
- **Welding position requirements**
- **Atmospheric conditions**
- **Quality requirements**

## Process Characteristics

### Penetration
- Generally deeper than GMAW
- Excellent for thick materials
- Good joint preparation tolerance

### Deposition Rate
- Higher than SMAW and GTAW
- Comparable to or higher than GMAW
- Excellent for high-production applications

### Fume Generation
- Higher than GMAW
- Ventilation requirements more critical
- Consider fume extraction systems

### Spatter
- Generally higher than GMAW
- Self-shielded variants produce more spatter
- Gas-shielded variants produce less spatter

## Basic Techniques

### Setup and Adjustment
1. Select appropriate flux-cored wire
2. Choose shielding gas (if required)
3. Set voltage and wire feed speed
4. Adjust gas flow rate (if applicable)
5. Check contact tip and nozzle condition

### Starting the Arc
- Pull trigger to start wire feed and power
- Maintain proper work angle (5-15 degrees)
- Keep consistent distance from workpiece (1/2 to 3/4 inch)

### Travel Technique
- **Drag angle**: Gun angled away from direction of travel
- **Travel speed**: Adjust for proper penetration and appearance
- **Weave pattern**: For wider joints when necessary
- **Gun position**: Maintain consistent angle and distance

### Welding Positions
1. **Flat (1G/1F)**: Highest deposition rate
2. **Horizontal (2G/2F)**: Requires more skill to control puddle
3. **Vertical (3G/3F)**: Upward progression preferred
4. **Overhead (4G/4F)**: Most challenging, requires proper technique
