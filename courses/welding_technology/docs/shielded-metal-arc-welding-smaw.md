# Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW)

Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), commonly known as "stick welding," is one of the most widely used welding processes in construction, maintenance, and repair applications. This module provides a comprehensive overview of SMAW equipment, electrodes, techniques, and applications.

## Process Overview

SMAW uses a consumable electrode coated with flux to create an electric arc between the electrode and the workpiece. The heat from the arc melts the electrode and base metal, forming a weld pool. The flux coating decomposes to provide shielding gas and slag that protect the molten metal from atmospheric contamination.

## Equipment Requirements

### Power Source
SMAW requires a constant current (drooping characteristic) power source that can provide:
- **AC or DC output**: Both types are available
- **Ampere range**: Typically 30-500 amps depending on application
- **Voltage range**: 20-40 volts at working conditions

### Welding Cables
- **Work cable (ground cable)**: Connects power source to workpiece
- **Electrode cable**: Connects power source to electrode holder
- Adequate size for current capacity to minimize voltage drop

### Electrode Holder
- Holds electrode securely
- Provides electrical connection
- Designed for comfortable handling
- Insulated to protect welder

### Chipping Hammer and Wire Brush
- **Chipping hammer**: Removes slag from welds
- **Wire brush**: Cleans base metal and finished welds

## Electrodes

SMAW electrodes consist of a core wire surrounded by a flux coating. The flux coating serves several functions:
- Provides shielding gases and slag
- Stabilizes the arc
- Adds deoxidizers and alloying elements
- Controls penetration and weld shape

### Electrode Classification System
The American Welding Society (AWS) uses a standardized classification system:
- **First two digits**: Minimum tensile strength (in thousands of psi)
- **Third digit**: Recommended welding position
- **Fourth digit**: Type of coating and current type

Examples:
- **E6010**: 60,000 psi tensile strength, all positions, cellulose sodium coating
- **E7018**: 70,000 psi tensile strength, all positions, iron powder low hydrogen coating

### Common Electrode Types

#### E6010 and E6011
- Deep penetration
- Good for dirty or rusty steel
- DC only (E6010) or AC/DC (E6011)
- Cellulose-based coating
- Used for root passes in pipe welding

#### E7018
- Excellent weld quality and appearance
- Low hydrogen coating
- Smooth, stable arc
- DC only (most common)
- Preferred for structural work

#### E7024
- High deposition rate
- Flat and horizontal positions only
- Iron powder coating
- Easy to use for beginners
- Self-limiting arc

### Electrode Selection Factors
- Base metal thickness and type
- Joint design and position
- Required mechanical properties
- Service conditions (corrosion, temperature)
- Available power source

## SMAW Techniques

### Basic Setup
1. Select appropriate electrode for material and position
2. Set correct amperage (typically 30-40 amps per 1/32 inch of electrode diameter)
3. Connect work lead to clean base metal
4. Insert electrode into holder and tighten

### Starting the Arc
Two common methods:
1. **Scratch start**: Scratch electrode across workpiece like striking a match
2. **Tap start**: Quickly tap electrode on workpiece and withdraw to establish arc

### Welding Positions
1. **Flat (1G/1F)**: Easiest position, electrode moves horizontally
2. **Horizontal (2G/2F)**: Gravity affects molten metal flow
3. **Vertical (3G/3F)**: Either upward (against gravity) or downward technique
4. **Overhead (4G/4F)**: Most challenging, requires proper technique

### Basic Welding Technique
1. Maintain consistent arc length (approximately electrode diameter)
2. Move electrode in direction of welding at appropriate speed
3. Angle electrode 10-15 degrees in direction of travel
4. Weave pattern for wider joints (if needed)
5. Control puddle flow and size

### Travel Speed
- Too fast: Insufficient penetration and reinforcement
- Too slow: Excessive buildup, possible burn-through
- Proper speed: Consistent appearance and adequate penetration

## Common Defects and Troubleshooting

### Porosity
- **Cause**: Contaminated base metal, damp electrodes, inadequate shielding
- **Prevention**: Clean base metal, use dry electrodes, avoid drafty conditions

### Incomplete Fusion
- **Cause**: Insufficient heat, fast travel speed, improper technique
- **Prevention**: Increase amperage, slow travel speed, proper joint preparation

### Undercut
- **Cause**: Excessive current, incorrect electrode angle, slow travel speed
- **Prevention**: Reduce amperage, correct electrode angle, increase travel speed

### Overlap
- **Cause**: Insufficient heat, too much filler metal, incorrect technique
- **Prevention**: Increase amperage, reduce electrode size, improve technique

### Cracking
- **Cause**: High carbon/hydrogen content, rapid cooling, restraint
- **Prevention**: Preheat when necessary, use low hydrogen electrodes, control cooling

## Safety Considerations

### Electrical Safety
- Inspect cables and connections before use
- Never change electrodes with power on
- Keep work area dry
- Use proper grounding techniques

### Arc Radiation
- Wear appropriate welding helmet with proper shade lens
- Protect skin from UV radiation with long sleeves and gloves
- Protect others from arc flash with screens or barriers

### Fumes and Gases
- Ensure adequate ventilation
- Position head away from fumes
- Use respiratory protection in confined spaces

### Fire Hazards
- Remove flammable materials from work area
- Have fire extinguisher available
- Monitor for sparks and hot metal

## Applications

### Structural Steel
- Building construction
- Bridge fabrication
- Industrial structures

### Pipeline Welding

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- High portability (can run on generator power)
- Works in various positions
- Effective in windy conditions
- Low equipment cost
- Simple equipment (fewer parts to maintain)

### Limitations
- Slower than other processes
